# Fuzzy_Extension_Principle
 Fuzzy Extension Principle and Fuzzy Arithmatic
 A: fuzzy set defined on X
 y= f(x): functional transform or mapping
 B: image of A on X under f
 B is a fuzzy set having universe of discourse Y
 B = f(A)	
#
 General definition: Suppose f is a mapping from an n-dimentional
 Cartesian product space X1 × X2 × … × Xn to a one dimentional
 universe Y such that and suppose A1,A2,…,An are
 n fuzzy sets in x1,x2, .., xn respectively. Then, the image of
 A1,A2,…,An under f is given as:
 max{min(...)}
